## Project Description

We will create an interface written in Python to obtain, analyze, and visualize daily box office data from the internet. The project will be a collaborative effort and will consist of the components listed below, in line with the project requirements.

## Project Outline/Plan



### Interface Plan

The interface will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) generated with Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library, or a web interface, created with Flask. Our interface will have at least two windows, such as a home screen and a pop-up window.
Our interface will have at least 4 widgets such as buttons, drop-down windows, or otherwise that allow the user to gather, update, and interact with the data.

### Data Collection and Storage Plan

Data will be scraped from [Box Office Mojo(https://www.boxofficemojo.com/date/) website and stored in monthly csv files. 

### Data Analysis and Visualization Plan

We will use Python's numpy package to calculate trends in the data over time and use matplotlib and/or seaborn to visualize the data as a timeseries.
